            There's a student dead at the library, and the whole campus is
            asking one question: "Who Dunn It?" In this thrilling 
            account of life on the campus of a small college in the middle
            of Iowa, interviewers search for the answer to that very 
            question. Along the way they discover secrets of students and
            teachers and somehow find some humor in this grim situation.
