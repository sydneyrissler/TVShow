        <p>There's a student dead at the library, and the whole campus is
asking one question: "Who Dunn It?" In this thrilling 
account of life on the campus of a small college in the middle
of Iowa, interviewers search for the answer to that very 
question. Along the way they discover secrets of students and
teachers and somehow find some humor in this grim situation. </p>
